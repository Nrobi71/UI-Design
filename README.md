# TASK 1 and 2


## TASK 1: PROJECT PROPOSAL WITH STRATEGIES

# INTRODUCTION:

I evaluated the provided “Paradigm Pet Professionals Website” in the Web Links section and the attached “Paradigm Pet Professionals UI Design Specifications.” I developed plans to create information architecture for various user personas and stakeholder needs while adhering to accessibility standards. I also developed a maintenance plan that includes SEO and consideration of a future mobile-friendly web page design.



# SCENARIO:

Its website was designed by a part-time intern 10 years ago. Most people who visit the website are prospective and new pet owners located in the United States who seek information about basic pet care and are interested in speaking with a consultant. Paradigm Pet Professionals contracted with Synesthor’s UI/UX department to develop a responsive website to meet the needs of its company and the needs of users.

Your first task is to evaluate the existing website and user design specifications provided by Paradigm Pet Professionals (see Web Links and Supporting Documents sections). You will also develop a sitemap, wireframe, and maintenance plan for the redeveloped website.
